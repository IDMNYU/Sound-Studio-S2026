## Assignment 1: Steal a Sound

**Part 1**: Browse [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0p5f1oNOSdk-sj7uWuxvq8b4h3m7r8-P&jct=4rkibc6s4DL7tIOHprd5jw) and listen to at least 5 of the included sound works. Make a note of at least one that stood out to you, and be prepared to discuss what was interesting about it.

**Part 2**: In the same spirit of the YouTube playlist, bring a sound to class that you find interesting. This can be from a pop song, it can be the sound of your apartment's door squeaking, it can be sound from a movie, it can be anything that has a unique quality that you'd like to discuss or emulate. Bring that sound to class as a 30-second WAV clip. To do this, you'll have to figure out how to capture audio from an existing source, how to trim it down to 30 seconds, and how to export it as a WAV file. Add your file to [this Google Drive folder before next class](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OlxZ_gPnI1vCDJ1-4CVaW9cGEwv8yGIi?usp=sharing).

Bring your findings to class on **January 27th**.
