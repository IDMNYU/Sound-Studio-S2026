## Assignment 2: The Idea of Jay St

**Part 1**: Go out and record the sandscape of the Tandon campus and its surrounding area, collecting at least 10 recordings around 30 seconds in length. Consider the classification of sounds we discussed in class – what kind of sounds are representative of the Tandon-area soundscape? 

**Part 2**: Design a playback system in Max that creates a generative collage of the sounds you recorded.

Some things to consider when assembling your patch:
- How are your sounds sequenced? Is there a specific order or is it random?
- Do sounds overlap each other? If so, how do they sound when they are layered?
- Do your sounds load automatically?
- Does your composition have a start and end or does it loop forever?

Upload all your audio and your Max patch into this Google Drive folder before class on **February 3rd**.
