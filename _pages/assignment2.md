## Assignment 2: The Idea of Jay St

**Part 1**: Listen to the following audio collages:

- [John Cage - Williams Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ql4Ophbt7k)
- [Bebe and Louis Barron - Forbidden Planet soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aryHMPH7Kcc)

**Part 2**: Go out and record the sandscape of the Tandon campus and its surrounding area, collecting at 5 minutes of audio, organized either into separate files or a single file. Consider the classification of sounds noted in [R Murray Schafer's text "The Soundscape" (page 139)](https://monoskop.org/images/d/d4/Schafer_R_Murray_The_Soundscape_Our_Sonic_Environment_and_the_Tuning_of_the_World_1994.pdf) – what kind of sounds are representative of the Tandon-area soundscape? 

**Part 3**: Design a playback system in Max that creates a generative collage of the sounds you recorded.

Some things to consider when assembling your patch:
- How are your sounds sequenced? Is there a specific order or is it random?
- Do sounds overlap each other? If so, how do they sound when they are layered?
- Do your sounds load automatically?
- Does your composition have a start and end or does it loop forever?

Upload all your audio and your Max patch into this Google Drive folder before class on **February 3rd**.
