## Assignment 4: Create an Effect!

Based on the different kinds of audio effects we explored in class, create an audio effect in Max/MSP.

Create your effect as a subpatcher, whose first inlet accepts audio, and whose second inlet accepts a toggle box to turn the effect on or off – a template for this can be found here. You may add one more parameter that is controllable by a third inlet, if you wish.

Next class, we will combine all your effects into one Max patch and run audio through them. Keep this notion of "chainability" in mind when you are designing your effect – how will your effect interact with other effects in the chain?

Name your subpatcher using this convention:

[p yourname_effectdescription]

[p craig_modulated_delay], for instance.

Upload your effect patch (demonstrating the use of your subpatcher) into [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hVxIJrMESRXxZL55HeSF9VN6kRi6Wf6W?usp=sharing) by 1pm  on **February 24th**.
