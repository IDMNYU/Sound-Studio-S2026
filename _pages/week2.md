- **BIT DEPTH**: amount of resolution per sample
- **SAMPLE RATE**: how many samples there are per second
    - Shannon-Nyquist theorem: to digitally encode a signal of frequency X, you need X*2 values at minimum
    - Typical audio sample rates are 44100 Hz (CD quality) and 48000 Hz
- **WAV** and **AIFF** are uncompressed audio file formats that store PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) streams of audio data. 
- **MP3**, **MP4**, **AAC** and other formats are compressed, which typically reduce file size by discarding data that humans likely won't hear. MP3 compression groups audio into frequency bands, then removes less perceptible data.
