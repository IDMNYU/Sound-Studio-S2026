- **BIT DEPTH**: amount of resolution per sample
- **SAMPLE RATE**: how many samples there are per second
    - Shannon-Nyquist theorem: to digitally encode a signal of frequency X, you need X*2 values at minimum
    - Typical audio sample rates are 44100 Hz (CD quality) and 48000 Hz
- **WAV** and **AIFF** are uncompressed audio file formats that store PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) streams of audio data. 
- **MP3**, **MP4**, **AAC** and other formats are compressed, which typically reduce file size by discarding data that humans likely won't hear. MP3 compression groups audio into frequency bands, then removes less perceptible data.

## Deep Listening
- A concept introduced by American composer Pauline Oliveros to describe embodied acts of listening
- Includes bodywork, meditation, as well as listening to the sounds of daily life and nature.
Cultivates a heightened awareness of the sonic environment.
- “Deep Listening involves going below the surface of what is heard, expanding to the whole field of sound while finding focus. This is the way to connect with the acoustic environment, all that inhabits it, and all that there is.” - [Oliveros](https://www.deeplistening.rpi.edu/deep-listening/)
