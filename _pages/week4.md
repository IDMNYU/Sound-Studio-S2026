- [History of Audio Effects](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Sound%20Studio%20Seminar%20Class%204.drawio&dark=auto#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D13WU4Z74miNzXT7LY4eaA_FYWocEhmWln%26export%3Ddownload)

**Audio Processing concepts**:

- *Delay*: Apply a time delay or echo to a sound. Delay effects typically blend the original audio with delayed audio using a mixer. Delay effects sometimes also have a feedback function, which allows for the sound to repeat itself over and over, producing a reverb-like effect.
- *Reverb*: Simulates reverberation. Gives a sound a sense that it is occupying a space, like a concert hall. Reverbs can be physical (as in an echo chamber), electromechanical (as in a plate reverb or spring reverb), or electronic (through analog or digital signal processing). 
- *Compression*: Changes the dynamic range of a sound. Compression can "lift" the quieter parts of a sound, reducing the dynamic range and making all parts of a sound louder and more present. While some compressors "color" the sound, typically the goal is to increase the loudness and presence of a particular sound without *clipping* or distorting the sound. Compression effects typically have an attack and decay setting, allowing you to change the sustain of transients. 
- *Distortion*: intentionally *clipping* or altering the shape of a sound with gain, with the goal of ampilfying or adding harmonic information. Distortion effects rely on different methods of driving a signal to generate different clipping characteristics, such as using vacuum tubes or Germanium transistors.
- *Filters/Equalizers*: Cutting or amplifying different parts of the frequency range. A "wah wah" style effect changes the frequency that is being cut according to an expression pedal.
- *Chorus/Flanging*: Creates a "doubled" effect by applying a very fast delay. The delay time can be modulated to create a "shimmering" effect.
- *Tremolo/Vibrato*: Like an LFO, modulating the volume (Tremolo) or pitch (Vibrato).
